a. What server framework did you choose and why?
    As I am familiar with JavaScript and got the opportunity to work on a new framework, I chose to work with NodeJs.
    Node JS is also a widely used and rapidly developing framework.
    It gives us to use the same language on the client, server and also in the database.

b. What client framework did you choose and why?
    JQuery is the client framework I chose. The advantage in using JQuery is that the tables can be generated by inserting a reference to a JavaScript library.
    This also allows the code to work in multiple environments.

c. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
    The server side implementation was easy than the client side as node JS libraries are built on asynchronous approach which provide a fast scalable system.
    
d. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
    The extra credit part of the project was difficult to implement. The implementation of displaying dots on the map was hard.
    
e. What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you install, if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?
    Other than client and server framework, Heroku was used to deploy the weblink for the project.
    
f. What Ubuntu commands are required to deploy and run your server?
    The Ubuntu commands used to deploy the project are:
    git add .
    git commit -m "changes made"
    git push heroku master
